Hi, me. This is your own C library. It is a rewrite of a bunch of useful
functions that you use in my 42 project. Since you're forbidden to use standard
functions, these are going to make your life there a piece of cake.

This repository is likely to be in constant change, so keep in mind that some
things might break.

But of course, make sure that this never happen when you're editing it.

To use it, just clone the repository inside your project. There's no need to 
run `make` here, your project should be able to compile the lib on its own
Makefile.

## make targets
The currently available targets are `all` (default), `libft.a`, `bonus`, `clean`,
`fclean` and `re`

`bonus` will be removed soon.
